# AI Development Environment Use Cases

This document provides deep examples showing how to leverage the sophisticated AI development system for real-world workflows.

## Multi-Profile Concurrent Development Workflows

### Enterprise Development Team Scenario
```bash
# Terminal 1: Senior Developer - Code Review & Architecture
ai claude --profile persistent
# Use: /agents -> core-dev-reviewer
# Memory persists across sessions for consistent code standards

# Terminal 2: DevOps Engineer - Deployment & Infrastructure  
ai claude --profile devops
# Use: /agents -> devops-deployer
# Full GitLab write access + K8s operations

# Terminal 3: QA Engineer - Testing & Validation
ai claude --profile qa  
# Use: /agents -> qa-test-runner
# GitLab read-only + Cypress + test-overlap-analyzer

# Terminal 4: Product Research - Requirements & Documentation
ai claude --profile research
# Use: /agents -> research-synthesizer
# Web search + memory + external documentation synthesis
```

### Complex Feature Development Pipeline
```bash
# Phase 1: Research & Requirements (research profile)
ai claude --profile research
# Ask: "Research OAuth 2.0 PKCE implementation best practices for mobile apps"
# Agent synthesizes external docs, stores findings in memory-bank

# Phase 2: Architecture & Implementation (persistent profile)  
ai claude --profile persistent
# Memory retains research context from Phase 1
# Ask: "Based on the OAuth research, implement PKCE flow in our React Native app"
# Use: /agents -> core-dev-reviewer for security review

# Phase 3: Testing & Validation (qa profile)
ai claude --profile qa
# Ask: "Create comprehensive E2E tests for the OAuth PKCE implementation"
# Use: /agents -> qa-test-runner for test execution and coverage analysis

# Phase 4: Deployment (devops profile)
ai claude --profile devops  
# Ask: "Deploy the OAuth changes to staging with proper K8s secrets management"
# Use: /agents -> devops-deployer for safe deployment practices
```

## Advanced Sub Agent Orchestration

### Automated Code Review Workflow
```bash
ai claude --profile persistent

# In Claude Code:
"I've implemented user authentication. Please conduct a comprehensive review."

# Claude automatically:
# 1. Routes to core-dev-reviewer agent
# 2. Agent reviews for security vulnerabilities, performance issues
# 3. Checks against remembered coding standards
# 4. Provides actionable feedback in main conversation
# 5. Memory persists decisions for future reviews
```

### Deployment Automation with Safety Checks
```bash
ai claude --profile devops

# In Claude Code:
"Deploy branch JIRA-123-user-auth to production"

# devops-deployer agent automatically:
# 1. Checks GitLab CI/CD pipeline status
# 2. Validates K8s cluster health
# 3. Reviews deployment configuration
# 4. Executes deployment with proper rollback procedures
# 5. Monitors deployment success
```

## Environment Variable Synchronization Mastery

### Project Onboarding Scenario
```bash
# New team member setup
cd new-microservice-project

# 1. Create local project environment
cat > .env << EOF
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/microservice_dev
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SERVICE_PORT=3001
EOF

# 2. Sync to global AI environment (adds to ~/.local/ai-dev/.env)
ai env-sync
# ✅ Updated DATABASE_URL
# ✅ Updated REDIS_URL  
# ✅ Updated SERVICE_PORT

# 3. Initialize with full context
ai init
# Now all AI tools understand both:
# - Global credentials (GitLab, JIRA tokens)
# - Project-specific config (database, ports)

# 4. Launch with complete environment
ai claude --profile persistent
# AI has access to both global and project context
```

### Multi-Environment Management
```bash
# Global ~/.local/ai-dev/.env (shared across all projects)
GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=glpat-xyz...
JIRA_API_TOKEN=xyz...
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Your Name"
MEMORY_BANK_ROOT=/Users/you/.local/ai-dev/memory-banks

# Project A: Frontend
cd frontend-app
cat > .env << EOF
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api-staging.company.com
REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS=auth,notifications
EOF

# Project B: Backend API
cd ../backend-api  
cat > .env << EOF
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/api_dev
JWT_SECRET=local-dev-secret-123
EXTERNAL_API_KEY=dev-key-456
EOF

# Both projects inherit global AI credentials
# Plus their own specific runtime configuration
ai claude --profile persistent  # Works in both projects with full context
```

## Profile-Based Workflow Specialization

### DevOps-First Development
```bash
# Start with infrastructure perspective
ai claude --profile devops

# Claude has immediate access to:
# - GitLab repositories (read/write)
# - Kubernetes clusters  
# - Container registries
# - CI/CD pipelines

# Example workflows:
"Set up GitLab CI/CD for this Node.js microservice with staging and production environments"
"Create K8s manifests for horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory"
"Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases"
```

### Research-Driven Architecture
```bash
ai claude --profile research

# Persistent memory + web search enables:
"Research and compare GraphQL federation approaches for microservices architecture"
# - Searches current documentation
# - Stores findings in memory-bank
# - Builds knowledge base over time

# Later sessions remember previous research:
"Based on our GraphQL federation research, help implement Apollo Gateway"
# - Recalls previous findings
# - Builds on established knowledge
# - Maintains architectural consistency
```

## Cross-Session Knowledge Persistence

### Long-Term Project Memory
```bash
# Week 1: Architecture decisions
ai claude --profile persistent
"Let's establish coding standards for this React project"
# Decisions stored in memory-bank

# Week 3: Feature implementation  
ai claude --profile persistent
"Implement user dashboard following our established patterns"
# Recalls Week 1 decisions automatically

# Week 6: Code review
ai claude --profile persistent
# Use: /agents -> core-dev-reviewer
# Agent has memory of all previous standards and decisions
```

### Team Knowledge Sharing
```bash
# Shared memory-bank across team members
export MEMORY_BANK_ROOT="/shared/team/ai-memory"

# Team member A: Documents API design
ai claude --profile persistent
"Document our RESTful API conventions and validation patterns"

# Team member B: Implements new service  
ai claude --profile persistent  
"Create a new user service following our documented API conventions"
# Automatically recalls Team A's documentation
```

## Engineering Workflow Integration

### Automated JIRA Integration
```bash
ai claude --profile devops

# Single command triggers full workflow:
"Create and implement user notification preferences feature"

# AI automatically:
# 1. Creates JIRA ticket: "PROJ-456: Implement user notification preferences"
# 2. Creates Git branch: "PROJ-456-user-notification-preferences"  
# 3. Implements feature following project conventions
# 4. Creates comprehensive tests
# 5. Opens merge request with proper template
# 6. Updates JIRA status to "In Review"
```

### Quality Assurance Pipeline
```bash
# Trigger comprehensive QA workflow
ai claude --profile qa

"Validate the authentication module for production readiness"

# qa-test-runner agent:
# 1. Runs existing E2E test suites
# 2. Analyzes test coverage gaps
# 3. Creates additional test scenarios
# 4. Generates test overlap analysis
# 5. Provides production readiness report
```

## Advanced MCP Server Utilization

### GitLab Integration Mastery
```bash
ai claude --profile devops

# Complex GitLab operations:
"Analyze all open merge requests, identify those blocked by CI failures, and create summary report"
"Set up automated deployment pipeline with approval gates for production releases"
"Review security vulnerabilities across all repository dependencies"
```

### Cross-Tool Data Flow
```bash
# Research → Development → Deployment pipeline
ai claude --profile research
"Research container security best practices for Node.js applications"
# Findings stored in memory-bank

ai claude --profile persistent  
"Implement the container security practices we researched"
# Accesses research findings from memory

ai claude --profile devops
"Deploy with the security-hardened containers to production"
# Applies both research and implementation context
```
